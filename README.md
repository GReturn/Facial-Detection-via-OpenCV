# Facial-Detection-via-OpenCV
A simple Python code that recognizes faces of humans, and rarely, faces of ghosts. More features coming soon as I continue to study the OpenCV documentation.

### Want to detect not only human faces, but also inanimate objects? 
Read the `note.md` in the `resx` directory.
