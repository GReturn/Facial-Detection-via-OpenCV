# Facial-Detection-via-OpenCV
A simple Python code that recognize the faces of humans, and rarely, faces of ghosts. More features coming soon as I continue to study the OpenCV documentation.

## About
This is a project by Lin as a way to challenge himself to create a facial detection software within 2 days. As he is typing this right now, he is currently under immense headache from the back all the way to the front. If you wish to add more features into this project, you are free to contribute. If you don't know how to code, reach me out in Twitter or Discord. Have fun!

### Want to detect not only human faces, but also inanimate objects? 
Sorry... I still need to work on that. I'm only using Haar Cascade. Still need to do more research.
