# Facial-Detection-via-OpenCV
A simple Python code that recognize the faces of humans, and rarely, faces of ghosts. More features coming soon as I continue to study the OpenCV documentation.

## About
This is a project by Lin as a way to challenge himself to create a facial detection software within 2 days. As he is typing this right now, he is currently under immense headache from the back all the way to the front. If you wish to add more features into this project, you are free to contribute.

### Want to detect not only human faces, but also inanimate objects? 
~~Sorry... I still need to work on that. I'm only using Haar Cascade. Still need to do more research.~~
You can! The [coco-detect.py][coco-detect] file simply does that.

[coco-detect]: https://github.com/GReturn/Facial-Detection-via-OpenCV/blob/main/Face-Detect-OpenCV/coco-detect.py

I think this will be my last commit to this repo. I'm no longer touching data science until I learn the maths about it.

Dear future me,

Make sure you cringe at your past, you piece of shit. You were nothing but a fraud that just watched YouTube videos and copy-pasted codes from documentations and sites but still show off to you friends in Facebook. Hope you're no longer coding. Sayonara, fucker.
